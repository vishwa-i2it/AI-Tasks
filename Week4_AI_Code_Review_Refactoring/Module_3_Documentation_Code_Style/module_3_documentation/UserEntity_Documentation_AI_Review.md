# AI Documentation & Code Style Review: User.java (Entity)

## AI Prompt
```
Please review the following Java entity class for documentation and code style. Identify any missing Javadoc on the class or fields, unclear field names, or inconsistent formatting. Suggest and show improvements.

@src/User.java
```

## AI Findings
- **Documentation:**
  - Class-level Javadoc is present but could be more descriptive.
  - Most fields lack Javadoc comments explaining their purpose.
- **Code Style:**
  - Field names are clear and follow Java conventions.
  - Formatting is consistent.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Add Javadoc to the class and all fields, especially those with business meaning (e.g., role, isEmailVerified).
  - Include usage examples in the class-level Javadoc if possible.

## Example Improvement: Add Javadoc to Class and Fields

### Before
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private String role;
    private Boolean isEmailVerified;
    // ...
}
```

### After
```java
/**
 * Entity representing a user in the system.
 * <p>
 * This class contains user account information, authentication details, and role assignments.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Your Team
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @since 2024-01-01
 *
 * @example
 * User user = new User("alice@example.com", "hashedPassword", "ADMIN", true);
 */
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    /** User's email address (unique, required) */
    private String email;
    /** Hashed password for authentication */
    private String password;
    /** User's role (e.g., ADMIN, CUSTOMER) */
    private String role;
    /** Whether the user's email is verified */
    private Boolean isEmailVerified;
    // ...
}
```

**Summary:**
- Adding Javadoc to the class and fields improves code readability, maintainability, and helps other developers understand the entity's structure and purpose.
