# AI Documentation & Code Style Review: PlantService.java

## AI Prompt
```
Please review the following Java service class for documentation and code style. Identify any missing Javadoc, unclear variable/method names, or inconsistent formatting. Suggest and show improvements.

@src/PlantService.java
```

## AI Findings
- **Documentation:**
  - Some public methods lack Javadoc comments.
  - Class-level Javadoc is present but could be more descriptive.
- **Code Style:**
  - Variable and method names are clear and follow Java conventions.
  - Formatting is consistent.
- **Suggestions:**
  - Add Javadoc to all public methods, especially those used by other modules.
  - Expand class-level Javadoc to include usage examples.

## Example Improvement: Add Javadoc to a Method

### Before
```java
public Plant getPlantById(Long id) {
    logger.debug("Retrieving plant with ID: {}", id);
    return plantRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Plant", id));
}
```

### After
```java
/**
 * Retrieves a plant by its unique identifier.
 *
 * @param id the plant ID
 * @return the Plant entity if found
 * @throws ResourceNotFoundException if no plant with the given ID exists
 */
public Plant getPlantById(Long id) {
    logger.debug("Retrieving plant with ID: {}", id);
    return plantRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Plant", id));
}
```

**Summary:**
- Adding Javadoc to public methods improves code readability, maintainability, and helps other developers understand the API.
