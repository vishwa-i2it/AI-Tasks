# Daily Mini-Challenge: Review Practice â€” AI-Assisted Code Review of `BookService`

## 1. Overview

The `BookService` class manages book-related business logic, including search, creation, update, deletion, and borrowing/returning books. It interacts with the `BookRepository` and enforces business rules such as ISBN uniqueness and book availability.

---

## 2. Strengths

- **Separation of Concerns:** Business logic is separated from controller and repository layers.
- **Transactional Integrity:** Write operations are annotated with `@Transactional` to ensure atomicity.
- **Validation:** Checks for ISBN uniqueness and book availability are present.
- **Use of DTOs:** Paging and search results are wrapped in response DTOs for API clarity.
- **Consistent Exception Handling:** Uses custom exceptions for business rule violations and resource not found cases.

---

## 3. Areas for Improvement

### a. Code Duplication in Paging Methods
- Methods like `getAvailableBooksPaged`, `getBooksByGenrePaged`, and `getBooksByAuthorPaged` repeat similar logic for sorting and paging.
- **Suggestion:** Extract a private helper method for pageable creation and consider a more generic paged search method.

### b. Potential for Race Conditions
- The `borrowBook` and `returnBook` methods update book quantities but do not lock the book record. In high-concurrency environments, this could lead to inconsistent available quantities.
- **Suggestion:** Use database-level optimistic/pessimistic locking or versioning for the `Book` entity.

### c. Business Rule Location
- The check for active loans before deleting a book is in the service, but the actual loan check is on the `Book` entity (`book.getLoans().isEmpty()`). This assumes the entity is always loaded with its loans.
- **Suggestion:** Consider a repository query to check for active loans, or document the expectation for entity loading.

### d. Validation Consistency
- Input validation (e.g., for null/empty fields) is mostly handled at the DTO/controller level, but some checks (like ISBN uniqueness) are in the service.
- **Suggestion:** Ensure all business rule validations are consistently enforced and consider using validation annotations where possible.

### e. Error Messages
- Exception messages are clear, but could be further standardized for API consumers (e.g., using error codes).

## 4. Example Refactor: Extract Pageable Helper

**Before:**
```java
Sort sort = Sort.by(
    sortDir.equalsIgnoreCase("desc") ? Sort.Direction.DESC : Sort.Direction.ASC,
    sortBy
);
Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(page, size, sort);
```

**After:**
```java
private Pageable createPageable(int page, int size, String sortBy, String sortDir) {
    Sort sort = Sort.by(
        sortDir.equalsIgnoreCase("desc") ? Sort.Direction.DESC : Sort.Direction.ASC,
        sortBy
    );
    return PageRequest.of(page, size, sort);
}
```
- Use this helper in all paged methods to reduce duplication.

---

## 5. Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Concurrency:** Add locking/versioning to prevent race conditions on book quantity.
- **DRY Principle:** Refactor repeated code for paging and sorting.
- **Documentation:** Add Javadoc to public methods, especially those with business rules.
- **Validation:** Use Bean Validation annotations where possible, and centralize business rule checks.
- **Testing:** Ensure unit and integration tests cover edge cases (e.g., borrowing unavailable books, deleting books with loans).
