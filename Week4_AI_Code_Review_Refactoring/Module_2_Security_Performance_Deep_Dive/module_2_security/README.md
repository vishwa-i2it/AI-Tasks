# Module 2: Security & Performance Deep Dive

## Goal
- Use AI to scan for security vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
- Analyze and optimize performance bottlenecks
- Apply refactoring patterns for maintainability

## Instructions
1. Select a code module with potential security or performance issues.
2. Use an AI tool to scan for vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.
3. Apply suggested fixes and refactorings.
4. Document before/after code and results in this folder.

## Overview
This module focuses on using AI to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks in code. It includes practical reviews and refactoring exercises.

## Contents
- `SpringController_Security_AI_Review.md`: AI-driven security review of a Spring controller.
- `AuthJS_AsyncBcrypt_AI_Review.md`, `AuthJS_RateLimiting_AI_Review.md`, `AuthJS_Security_Performance_AI_Review.md`: Security and performance reviews for authentication modules.
