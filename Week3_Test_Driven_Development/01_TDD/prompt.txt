1. 

I want to build a calculator function that can add two numbers.
Create a failing test using Jest that:
- Tests adding 2 + 3 = 5
- Tests adding negative numbers
- Tests adding decimal numbers
- Uses clear, descriptive test names

Language: JAVA


2. 

Create the simplest add function that will make these tests pass.
Don't over-engineer it, just make it work.

3.

Look at this add function and tests. Can you improve the code quality
while keeping all tests passing? Consider:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Code documentation


4. 

Add tests for the error handling I just added to the add function.
