**How to use this structure:**
- Each week's folder contains subfolders for each major task/module.
- Each module/task folder contains relevant code, documentation, and results.
- Capstone, design patterns, security, performance, and translation examples are now under `Week4_AI_Code_Review_Refactoring/Real_Tasks/` for easy tracking and review.
- All real project code (e.g., Library Management System) is under `Real_Projects/Library_Management_System/`.

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

- Start with the capstone project (GildedRose Refactoring Kata)
- Add missing design pattern, security, performance, and translation examples
- Complete remaining hands-on tasks
- Review and update documentation for consistency

---

**Recommendation:** Focus on the capstone and advanced examples to achieve 100% course completion.
