# AI Tasks

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of advanced, hands-on exercises and real-world projects focused on AI-driven software development. It is structured as a modular curriculum, guiding users through the application of AI tools and techniques for code generation, pattern recognition, test-driven development, code review, and refactoring.

## Folder Structure

- **Week2_AI_Code_Generation_Pattern_Recognition/**
  - Explore advanced prompt engineering, code architecture, pattern recognition, and language-specific optimization using AI.
  - Contains submodules for prompt patterns, architecture design, quality assessment, and optimization, each with practical exercises and code samples.

- **Week3_Test_Driven_Development/**
  - Focuses on test-driven development (TDD) with AI assistance.
  - Includes modules for TDD basics, test case generation strategies, and test case documentation, with Java-based code and test examples.

- **Week4_AI_Code_Review_Refactoring/**
  - Dedicated to AI-powered code review, documentation, security analysis, and advanced refactoring.
  - Contains daily mini-challenges, real-world tasks, and modules on code analysis, security, documentation, and design patterns.

- **Real_Projects/**
  - Contains real-world, end-to-end software projects.
  - Example: `Library_Management_System/` â€” a full-stack Java/React project with backend, frontend, documentation, and setup scripts.

- **task.md**
  - Contains task descriptions, instructions, or project requirements for the exercises and modules.

## Key Features
