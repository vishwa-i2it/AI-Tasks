# Module 5: Advanced AI Debugging Workflows & Best Practices – Practical Application

## Custom Debugging Workflow (Spring Boot Example)

### 1. Custom AI Debugging Workflows
- Used AI tools and code review to systematically identify and categorize bugs (state, performance, error handling, security).
- Created a repeatable workflow: Initial Analysis → Core Bug Fixes → Advanced Debugging → Production Readiness.

### 2. Building Your AI Debugging Toolkit
- Applied best practices: input validation, error handling, thread safety, and monitoring.
- Used actuator endpoints and structured error responses for observability and automation.

### 3. Advanced AI Prompting Techniques
- Used targeted prompts to:
  - Detect state management and performance issues.
  - Suggest error handling and security improvements.
  - Guide the step-by-step debugging and fixing process.

### 4. Capstone: AI Debugging Task – Spring Boot Demo
- The `week5-buggy-demo` and `week5-buggy-demo-fixed` projects serve as a capstone, demonstrating the full debugging and production hardening workflow.
- All changes and lessons learned are documented for team knowledge sharing and future prevention.
