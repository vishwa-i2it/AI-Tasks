# Week 5 Buggy Demo Fixed Spring Boot Project

This project contains the corrected implementation of the buggy demo, addressing all four challenges and improving production readiness.

## Challenge Fixes

### Challenge 1: State Management Bug (Beginner)
- The `Cart` model now returns a copy of its internal list, preventing external mutation and ensuring encapsulation.
- Added thread safety to the internal list for concurrent access.

### Challenge 2: Performance Issue (Intermediate)
- The `CartService` now uses a `HashSet` for O(1) item lookups, eliminating the O(n^2) performance bottleneck.
- Input validation is performed before adding items.

### Challenge 3: Error Handling Gap (Intermediate)
- The `CartController` now validates input, uses try-catch blocks, and returns proper HTTP responses with error messages.
- Uses `ResponseEntity` for consistent API responses.

### Challenge 4: Security Vulnerability (Advanced)
- The `SecurityController` only allows redirects to a whitelist of safe domains and requires authentication.
- Malformed URLs and unauthorized access are handled with appropriate error responses.

## Production Readiness
- **Monitoring:** Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`) are enabled for health checks and monitoring.
- **Security:** Basic authentication is enabled for demonstration. Credentials are set in `application.properties`.
- **Thread Safety:** Cart model is thread-safe for concurrent requests.
- **Error Handling:** All controllers return meaningful error messages and status codes.

## Workflow
- **Initial Analysis:** AI tools and code review identified bugs, bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities.
- **Core Bug Fixes:** State management and performance issues were fixed first.
- **Advanced Debugging:** Error handling and security vulnerabilities were addressed.
- **Production Readiness:** Monitoring, error handling, and documentation were improved.
