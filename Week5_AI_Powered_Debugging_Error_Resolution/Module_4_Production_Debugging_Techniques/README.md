# Module 4: Production Debugging Techniques â€“ Practical Application

## Real-World Debugging Workflow (Spring Boot Example)

A pair of Spring Boot projects (`week5-buggy-demo` and `week5-buggy-demo-fixed`) were created to demonstrate and resolve common production issues:

### 1. Live System Debugging
- **Buggy Demo:** Issues like state mutation and performance bottlenecks were present and observable via API endpoints.
- **Fixed Demo:** Issues were fixed, and endpoints could be tested live for correct behavior.

### 2. Safe Production Debugging
- **Buggy Demo:** No input validation or error handling, leading to unsafe production behavior.
- **Fixed Demo:** Input validation, error handling, and safe API responses were implemented.

### 3. Production Monitoring Setup
- **Buggy Demo:** No monitoring or health checks.
- **Fixed Demo:** Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`) enabled for live monitoring and health checks.

### 4. AI-Assisted Incident Response
- **Buggy Demo:** No structured error responses or logging.
- **Fixed Demo:** Consistent error messages and HTTP status codes, making it easier to automate incident response and root cause analysis.

### 5. Post-Incident Analysis
- **Buggy Demo:** No documentation or workflow for post-incident review.
- **Fixed Demo:** README documents all fixes, workflow, and lessons learned for future prevention and team learning.

**Reference:**
- See `week5-buggy-demo` for initial issues and `week5-buggy-demo-fixed` for all fixes and production readiness improvements.
- This workflow can be adapted to any Java/Spring Boot project for systematic production debugging and readiness.
