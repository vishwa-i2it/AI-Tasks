"Create a Plant-E-commerce implementation following Java/Spring Boot best practices:

Java-Specific Considerations:
- Use proper annotations (@Service, @Repository, @Component)
- Implement proper exception handling with custom exceptions
- Follow Java naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods)
- Use Optional<T> for nullable returns
- Implement proper logging with SLF4J
- Add validation annotations where appropriate
- Include proper JavaDoc documentation
- Consider thread safety if applicable
Spring Boot Specific:
- Use dependency injection properly
- Configure properties in application.yml format
- Include proper testing with @SpringBootTest
- Follow RESTful conventions for controllers"
